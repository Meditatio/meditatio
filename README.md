# Meditatio

# 1. Introduction 

Meditatio is a project developed by four EPITA students
during their semester abroad at UQAC, Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦

We aimed to create an Android application 
using Kotlin and Android Studio 
as part of a Mobile Computing class.

We decided to focus the app on meditation and sports. 

# 2. Main features

The main feature was to allow users 
to receive tips and exclusive videos on meditation and sports.

Another key feature was the ability for users to 
register and log into the app using the Firebase platform. 
Additionally, users could access an instant messaging feature 
to communicate with coaches directly within the app.
